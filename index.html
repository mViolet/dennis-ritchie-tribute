				<footer>- Dennis Ritchie, <cite>Unix: A Dialectic, 1989</cite></footer></blockquote>
				<p cite="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bigbio1st.html">Over four decades of his life, Dennis Ritchie made many lasting contributions to the world of computing. He is most well-known for co-creating the Unix operating system with Ken Thompson. It was while he was working on Unix that he created the C programming language. Both of these technologies and their descendants are widely used to this day.</p>
				<p cite="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bigbio1st.html">The C programming language is an improvement on another language that he and Ken Thompson worked on together, which Dennis Ritchie referred to as "Thompson's B". Dennis' improvements to B included new supported data types, and new syntax.</p>
				<p>Fun fact: In 1989, Dennis teamed up with the magic duo Penn & Teller and Rob Pike (Who worked on Unix as well as the Go programming language at Bell Labs, among other things) to play a prank on then Nobel Prize laureate and VP of Bell Labs Research Arno Penzias.
